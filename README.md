## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was created using Google Forms survey, ensuring comprehensive and reliable responses from the participants. The survey questionnaire was carefully designed to capture relevant information regarding user sport and physical activity preferences, behaviors, and demographics. The collected data provides a valuable foundation for conducting a detailed analysis and deriving meaningful insights.

By utilizing this self-collected dataset, we ensure that the analysis and visualizations presented in this project are based on a reliable and customized set of responses. This enables a more accurate understanding of user preferences and behaviors in the context of sports and physical activities.
